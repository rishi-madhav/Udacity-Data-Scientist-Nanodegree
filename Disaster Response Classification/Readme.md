**Disaster Response**
-----------------------
Disaster response organizations receive millions of messages following a disaster and because different organizations take care of different parts of the problem, there needs to be a way of directing messages to the appropriate organization so that they can respond to the problem accordingly. This web application was built to classify disaster messages so that an emergency professional would know which organization to send the message to. The application uses a classifier that was trained on the data described below. This is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree and this is only a basic version of the application intended for learning.

**Data**
-----------------------
The dataset contains 26,386 labeled messages that were sent during disasters around the world. Each message is labeled as 1 or more of the following 36 categories:
'related', 'request', 'offer', 'aid_related', 'medical_help', 'medical_products', 'search_and_rescue', 'security', 'military', 'child_alone', 'water', 'food', 'shelter', 'clothing', 'money', 'missing_people', 'refugees', 'death', 'other_aid', 'infrastructure_related', 'transport', 'buildings', 'electricity', 'tools', 'hospitals', 'shops', 'aid_centers', 'other_infrastructure', 'weather_related', 'floods', 'storm', 'fire', 'earthquake', 'cold',
