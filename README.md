## Udacity-Data-Scientist-Nanodegree
This repository contains my projects for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. It was a great 3 months of a steep learning curve! On to more learnings and advanced topics! And most importantly, building out a project portfolio like this one!

# Key concepts and lessons covered
1. Introduction to Data Science: Completed a Data Science project of my own choice with the basic concepts covered in this section. I worked on Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (Auto Insurance). I have written a <a href=https://medium.com/@rishi.madhav/can-data-make-you-drive-happily-45d91e9cf7be>Medium blog post</a> that talks about the process.

2. Software Engineering practices in Data Science

3. Data Engineering: Building an ETL and ML pipeline, converting them to Python scripts that can help run the data to model process on data stored in the cloud. The project was on "Disaster Response Message Classification" with tweets data that had to be classified. The entire model was then built into a web app that would output the classification of the message with the intent that a downstream application in real-life scenarios would know what action to be taken based on the message.

3. Experimental Design & Recommendations; Design experiments and analyze A/B test results. Explore approaches for building recommendation systems. Project was on building a recommendation system on comments related to IBM Watson Studio. I will need to explore this further as most of the code was part of the course itself.

4. Data Capstone Project. This was done in the Financial Domain - Multi-class Classification of Corporate Credit Ratings. I have written a <a href=https://medium.com/@rishi.madhav/classification-of-corporate-credit-ratings-and-identify-the-top-financial-ratios-f4796e215cbd>Medium blog post</a> to describe the process.
