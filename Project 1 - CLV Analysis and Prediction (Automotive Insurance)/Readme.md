* Seaborn
* Scikit Learn

## My Motivation
For this project, I was interested to analyse an automotive insurance dataset and understand more about the Customer Lifetime Value(CLV) that they are able to derive from that.
This is a dataset that I got from Kaggle, and since my current work deals with Data Analytics solutions for the automotive industry vertical, I felt this would be a relevant addition to the Data Science portfolio that I want to build.
The broad questions I want to answer from this dataset are:
* What are those factors (Numerical) that most influence the Customer Lifetime Value (positive / negative impact)?
* What is the demographic profile (key features) of the observed customers?
* Which are the key features that will be most useful in predicting CLV
* What are the key business recommendations we can make by observing and analysing this dataset?

I have taken this opportunity to put together a blog post as well on medium.com that describes the process of this exploratory data analysis I have conducted; and hopefully, I am making it engaging enough for you to read through the post. Any feedback is extremely helpful in my learning process!

## File Description
There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. 
Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

## Medium Blog Post
Detailed post describing my understanding of this project, the findings from the Data Analysis process and my analysis of the findings are available in this [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@rishi.madhav/can-data-make-you-drive-happily-45d91e9cf7be).
