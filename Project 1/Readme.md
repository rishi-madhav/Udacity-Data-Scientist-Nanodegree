## My Motivation
For this project, I was interested to analyse an automotive insurance dataset and understand more about the Customer Lifetime Value(CLV) that they are able to derive from that.
This is a dataset that I got from Kaggle, and since my current work deals with Data Analytics solutions for the automotive industry vertical, I felt this would be a relevant addition to the Data Science portfolio that I want to build.
The broad questions I want to answer from this dataset are:
* What are those features from the insurance business that influence the CLV?
* Does CLV depend on the the make, size or brand of a vehicle?
* What is the typical demographic characteristic (age, marital status, employment status, etc.) that influences CLV?
* How does feedback to Marketing influence CLV?

I have taken this opportunity to put together a blog post as well on medium.com that describes the process of this exploratory data analysis I have conducted; and hopefully, I am making it engaging enough for you to read through the post.
Any feedback is extremely helpful in my learning process!

## File Description
There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. 
Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

## Medium Blog Post
Detailed post describing the EDA process and my analysis of the findings are available here (will add URL later).
